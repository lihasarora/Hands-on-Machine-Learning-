# Hands-on-Machine-Learning

Coming from a non-computer science background, i was overwhelmed at first when I embarked on my journey to explore Machine Learning. 
However, visualizing each concept through python programing not only helped me hone my python programing skills but also helped me understand the mechanics of basics ML Algorithms
in an interactive way.

This repository has some of the initial concepts that I explored.
- Bias variance tradeoff (The tradeoff that plaques entire ML universe)
- Central limit theoram (The mother of all hypothesis)
- Law of large numbers (Something that I had just heard but never implemented)
- Bessel's correction to sample variance (Yes, we can visualize this as well)
- Bootstrapping (They say that simplicity is elegant, this technique is epitome of simplicity and usefulness)

I'll keep on adding more to it !!
