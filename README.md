# Hands-on-Machine-Learning

Coming from a non-computer science background, i was overwhelmed at first when I embarked on my journey to explore Machine Learning. 
However, visualizing each concept through python programing not only helped me hone my python programing skills but also helped me understand the mechanics of basics ML Algorithms
in an interactive way.

This repository has some of the initial concepts that I explored.
- Bias variance tradeoff (The tradeoff that plaques entire ML universe)
- More Detailed BV tradeoff (Grad program gives you a new perspective)
- Central limit theoram (The mother of all hypothesis testing)
- Bootstrapping (They say that simplicity is elegant, this technique is epitome of simplicity and usefulness)
- Visualizing properties of Principal Components (If you are a fan of Linear Algebra, you'll love this)
- Hierarchial Clustering in Python (Let's leran and plot some dendograms)
- Gradient Descent using Numpy (Going beyond model.fit() and model.predict() :D)
- Multivariate gaussian Distribution (The bases for visualizing multivariate distribution) 

I'll keep on adding more to it !!
